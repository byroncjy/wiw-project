FOREWORD
HO'S WHO IN COLORED AMERICA sets forth biographical data
concerning prominent persons of African descent who were living at the
time of compilation and whose position or record of achievement makes
them of general interest. An exception will be made of persons who died since the last
edition. They will be included once more to show the completion of that Life Story.
One line will be placed at the bottom of their sketch showing the date of death. A
Memoriam Page in the front of the book will show who they are.
It is our aim to publish these editions every two years. The First Edition was i pub-
lished in 1927. The Second (1928-1929): The Third (1930-1931-1932} The Fourth
(1933 1937). The Fifth Edit ion (1938-1939-mO). And this S'i'xth Edition.
Eligibility has been based on achievement, due latitude being allowed those persons
whose efforts show promise of future accomplishment or who, by reason of establish-
ing a precedent in some particular work, make it arbitrary that a record be made of
the fact.
It is doubtless true that the fitness of every name included will not be apparent to
every user of this book. The artist, the possessor of literary tastes, the scientist, etc.,
may miss names of their certain professions. It is a fact that we use every endeavor to
get this information to make the book useful in the highest degree. An invitation is
extended for the suggestions of new names.
Realizing that a record like WHO'S WHO IN COLORED AMERICA would not
be representative without the inclusion of some of the many persons who are achieving
success, but are unknown, the Publisher personally traveled for many months, visiting
many states, cities and towns, and interviewed many persons. From among these
were selected outstanding characters whose sketches are herein included.
Criticism may be passed on the fact that more of the careers refer specifically to pro-
fessional persons. This is answered by the statement that professional persons, having
bad the opportunity of interracial contact, realize the value of a record of this kind as
a means to a better understanding between peoples, and are, therefore, not so reticent,
when approached, as many others have shown themselves to be.
Reasons should be advanced for some of the omissions from this edition of sketches
which were included in former editions. It is because repeated requests for revision
and verification was not forthcoming, and present addresses could not be ascertained.
The sketches have been edited from an impartial point of view. No particular
group, denominational, political, or otherwise, has in any way influenced the policy un-
der which the work has been compiled. Not a single sketch has been paid for. No

person has or can secure inclusion of a sketch of his life-career by the payment of
money.
The length of the sketch does not necessarily indicate a person's position in national
or local affairs. The life history of one may, by reason of his varied interests in religi-
ous, fraternal, political or civic activities, take up more space in the book, than another,
representing a few outstanding achievements.
A number of photographic reproductions have been made part of this work. The
inclusion of the photograph was optional with the subject of the sketch.
WHO'S WHO IN COLORED AMERICA is intended to be a reference book, and
should be in every Public Library, Public School, State Capitol Library, College,
Newspaper Office, the offices of professional and business persons, and in private
homes. It is a source of exact information for the teacher and student for its historical
value, as it contains the Life Stories of persons who are worthy of inclusion in standard
histories, Bank and Insurance Company Presidents, Educators, Presidents, Deans and
officials of Universities, Colleges and Institutions, conducted directly or indirectly by
and for members of the Colored Race; members of the medical profession; attorneys-
at-law, and outstanding persons in political life; successful merchants; artists, authors,
editorial writers; the clergy; executive secretaries of organizations and persons en-
gaged in social work.
This volume is offered to persons of the Colored Race, that they may have for them-
selves and their children a historical record for racial self-respect and inspiration. It is
offered to the people of the United States as an authentic and dependable statement of
fact.

In the travels of the Publisher, seeking in-
formation, and by asking many questions, he

cation for Colored students who were com-
pelled to study outside of the State on ac-

tucky. The /\nderson-Mayer Act provides
the sum of $175 to Colored students for
their tuition with an annual appropriation
of $7,500.00.

ing positions; a bill to provide rural high

out high schools to grant a sum not less

students' to study in another County; spon-
sored a bill to prohibit discrimination on
account of race in employment on public
buildings, roads and work projects; fought
and successfully defeated a bill to segregate
white and Colored people on buses in Ken-
tucky; aided to increase the appropriations

When the United States joined the Allies in
the World War, Mr. Blanton was sent over-
seas as a "Y" worker. He, Dr. H. H. Proctor
and Miss Helen Hagen composed what was
known as the "Proctor Party," visiting 275,000
colored troops in various parts of France. They
went over immediately after the Armistice and
came back just about the time that all the
colored troops were gotten out of France, Sep-
tember, 1919.
Subsequent to the work in France, Mr. Blan-
ton visited Camps Dix, Meade, Lee, Green,
Jackson, Sevier, Wadsworth, Gordon, Sher-
idan and Shelby, working with colored troops
as a representative of the War Department.
His experience as Superintendent of the
Penn School at Frogmore, S. C, for 10 years
(1912-22) fitting him for the position of Prin-
cipal of the Voorhees School, where he is now
located. The course of study at Voorhees has
been steadily improving in the last six years
until it is now regarded as one of the standard
high schools of South Carolina.
The School has an average enrollment of 650
students, and in 33 years of its existence has
grown from a very small beginning to over
700 young men and women who get instruction
there. The Faculty is composed of 34 men and
women (all colored) and is drawn from reliable
Schools and Colleges, both North and South.
It owns 400 acres, 22 buildings, $39,000 en-
downment, making an actual valuation of $224,-
000.

The United Government Employees, un-
der his leadership, won favorable Congres-
sional action by securing more than a half
million dollars in pay increases to approxi-
mately 5,000 low-paid men and women la-
borers in the federal service of the United
States government, for the first time in the
nation's history, bringing them from the
basic pay of $1,080 to a $1,200 minimum
annual wage. This organization secured
legislation, in the 1939 U. S. National De-
fense Act and Civil Aeronautics Authority's
Training Act, insuring equal benefits for
Negro citizens desirous of becoming air
pilots in the U. S. Army and as civilian
flyers; U. S. Reserve Officers on active duty
in the CCC and 150 colored college grad-
uates who serve these camps as educational
advisers, engineers and in other technical
positions, in which program some 30,000
colored youths and war veterans, one-
tenth on the total enrollment participate
each year.
All this splendid work has been initiated
during the period of his employment as
Adviser on Negro Affairs to the CCC, to
which position he was appointed by Presi-
dent Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

and many of the leading daily newspapers
throughout the country have had accounts of
his remarkable feats.
He has done much for the advancement of
the Race in Knoxville, helping to secure in-
creased school facilities, playgrounds and libra-
ries. A tablet in the beautiful Carnegie Library,
in Knoxville, bears this inscription: "This
tablet is erected by the City Commissioners of
Knoxville in recognition of the faithful efforts
of Charles W. Cansler, who first conceived
the idea of this Library for his Race, and who
helped materially in securing it."
Another honor conferred by the City of
Knoxville was the naming of one of the lead-
ing streets of that city for his family.

Born of slave parents, he was carried away
with his mother by a band of raiders in the
last year ot the Civil War. His master sent a
rescuing, party to buy their release, but when
the searchers located them, Mary Carver, the
mother, had disappeared and was never again
heard from. George Washington was found
ill with whooping cough and was brought back
to Mr. Carver, his mother's master, who raised
him.
His early education was obtained from a
spelling book, until he was ten years of age.
He then was able to attend a rural school for
one year, working on neighboring farms mean-
time.
He made his way to Fort Scott, Kansas, and
for nine years worked as a domestic servant,
studying when he could and saving what monev
he was able to put aside after sustaining him-
self. He entered High School in Minneapolis,
Kansas, and completed the courses. For three
years he managed a laundry and accumulated
sufficient money to pay his expenses in Simp-
son College, Indianola, Iowa, where he took
literary work, art and music. Later entered
Iowa State College, working his way by doing
all sorts of work, whatever he could get to do.
Taking his Bachelor's and Master's degrees,
he was graduated and placed in charge of a
greenhouse, the bacteriological laboratory and
the department of systematic botany.
While a member of the Faculty at the Iowa
State College, he came to the attention of
Booker T. Washington, who asked him to join
his work at Tuskegee.

WHO'S WHO IN COLORED AMERICA
He took charge of the Chemical department
in Agriculture and built it up to national re-
nown.
He appeared before the Ways and Means
Committee of the House of Representatives
in Washington, which was considering the im-
position of a tariff on peanuts and spoke for
forty-five minutes although the time limit for
all speakers was five minutes, on the possibili-
ties and use of this nut. He told the Commi-
tee of Congress of the one hundred and sixty-
five products which had been created from it
by him.
His research has discovered over a hundred
products from the sweet potato, sixty articles
of value from the pecan, in addition to the
products from the peanut. He has extracted
dyes from the Southern clays.
He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society
of Great Britain for his contribution to Sci-
ence and in 1922 was presented with the Spin-
garn Medal for the most distinguished service
by an American Negro of that year.
He was given the Roosevelt award for
the outstanding achievement in the field of
science. No American deserved the award
more than the sage of the South, and the
committee which selected him must be
praised for so doing.

She is an intellectual, full, clean, strong,
serviceful and forceful woman. At the age of
six years she entered St. Augustine's Normal
and Collegiate Institute, Raleigh, N. G* At
eight years of age she was given certain classes
to teach or coach, and the following year she
was designated "Pupil Teacher." From that
time on she has given her entire life to study
and teaching, receiving her degree of Doctor of
Philosophy from Sorbonne, University of
Paris, in 1925.
The most significant fact perhaps, is her
contribution to education in Washington, D. C,
and the courageous revolt she waged against a
special Colored curriculum for the M Street
High School. A proposal was made by Con-
gress to give the pupils of this school a course
of study commensurate with their alleged in-
ferior abilities. While the proposal looked in-
nocent and benevolent, she stoutly maintained
that her pupils should have equal opportunity
to choose whatever subjects might be chosen if
they were in one of the other high schools. In
this contention she was supported by the two
Colored members of the Board of Education,
and she actually prepared pupils who passed
with honor the entrance examinations for Har-
vard, Yale, Brown, Oberlin and others.

Her husband, while in active practice as an
attorney-at-law in New York City, was ap-
pointed Minister Resident and Consul Gen-
eral to Liberia, West Africa, by the late Wood-
row Wilson in 1915. He served in that capacity
until 1917, when, after an operation performed
at the Base Hospital at Sierra Leone, West
Africa, he died. Mrs. Curtis brought his body
to the United States, after traveling on a tramp
steamer for thirty-one days through the War
Zone. While in the service in Liberia, Mr.
Curtis was instrumental in persuading that
country to join the Allies during the World
War. Mts. Curtis had charge of the industrial
department of Monrovia College and taught
sewing in the College of West Africa.
She was the first Negro woman to go abroad
when the United States entered the war, be-
ing selected as Y.M.C.A. Secretary in 1918.
While in France, she was the only woman to
have charge of a Leave Area at Charhbrey.
Her last work overseas was with the 10,000
Negro soldiers who re-buried the dead in the
burial grounds located at Romagne, France,
where 26,000 American soldiers were buried.
This is the largest American Cemetery in
France. .
In 1927 she presented to the children of
Liberia the equipment for a playground, the
erection of which she personally supervised.
It is the only playground of its kind on the
West Coast of Africa. On her return to New
York in 1927, she brought four African chil-
dren whom she is educating.

administration was characterized by increased
efficiency in all departments. The General Con-
ference of 1896 elected Dr. Scott to the editor-
ship of the Southwestern Christian Advocate,

He was the organizer of the football team
and athletics in the Colored public schools of
Washington, D. C. It will be very interesting to
many to learn just how the school colors of Red
and Black of the Washington schools were
adopted. The sweaters that were purchased
for the first game that was to be played were of
that color, and a flag was then made by Miss
Mineola Kirkland, who is now Supervisor, to
match the sweaters.

The Kansas City Call is considered one of
the leading newspapers in the Race and has
fearlessly championed the cause for better hous-
ing, safety from police brutality, participation
in jury service and better schools. Starting in
1919, except for two years, he has been the sole
owner and Editor. In June, 1931, a corporation
of $100,000 was formed, full paid, no stock be-
ing held by outsiders, The shares held were
donated to some of the older employees for
their faithful service rendered to the paper. It
is the largest employer of Colored labor in
Kansas City judged by pay roll.

He was the defense counsel for the Lomans,
Aiken, S. C, in 1926. On the second trial one
of the three defendants was acquitted. On that
very night, fearing the acquittal of the other
two defendants, one being a woman, the three
were taken from jail and lynched.
In 1928 he was counsel for Ben Bess, who had
served 12 years in the Penitentary on a con-
viction of rape, on afterwards admitted perjury
testimony. He was pardoned by the Governor
of the State. Later the alleged victim repudi-
ated her statement. The Governor then revoked
the pardon and the man was again sent to the
Penitentiary. The case then went into the va-
rious Courts with the final result that the Su-
preme Court of South Carolina freed him.

Mr. Garnett was born a slave on the Carter
plantation, Gordon County, Georeia. He joined
Sherman's march to the sea at Milledgeville,
Ga., and remained with marching army un-
til it reached Savannah, Ga. From Savan-
nah, Ga., he went home with Capt. John
F. Anderson who lived at Callicoon, New-
York City.
On February 22, 1865, at Middletown, he
enlisted in the Infantry of New York Vol-
unteers, and was sent to a camp of mobili-
zation at Hart's Island, N. Y. In March,
1865, together with 1,100 other soldiers, he
was sent to South Carolina. On a stormy
voyage of 7 days, he had his feet frozen.
On this journey several froze to death and
were buried in deep sea. While at a hos-
pital in Beaufort, S. C, the war ended.
At the close of the war he was honorably
discharged and sent back to New York
City. Here he found himself without home,
kindred or friends. A raw boy, among
strangers in a great metropolitan city is
likely to encounter some strange vicissi-
tudes. He worked at odd jobs and attended
night school.

a Catholic Priest, of Chicago, 111., 1938, to model
and cast 100 statuettes, one foot high. Father
Dresher wroje: "I do not believe that -there is
a sculptor in the U. S. who can excell you in
producing a likeness:" made reproductions in
plaster of Beth Furnace Meteorite, and sold one
to each to Field Columbian Museum, Chicago;
Smithsonian Inst., Washington, D. C, and Ward's
Collection, Rochester, N. Y.; Address, Tuskegce
Institute, Ala.
His father was the slave of U. S. Senator
Garret Davis of Bourbon Co., Ky.
It seems a paradox that, notwithstanding
his avowed intentidn to devote his life to
modeling busts and sculptures of Negro
Life, his larger commissions, with the ex-
ception of two, have come from the white
race. The list of names includes many of
the most prominent in both white and
colored groups. His lectures on Art sub-
ects have been to both white and colored
colleges. He has the only life-mask extant
of Booker T. Washington, and was the
first person to correct and make pottery
of Tuskegee clays.
He has been commissioned by the Na-
tional College Emblem Co., of Indianapolis,
Ind., to model a relief plaque of Booker T.
Washington to be copied in bronze.

Matthew Alexander Henson (affectionately
called "Matt") was born less thali three years
after Emancipation, in Charles County, Md.,
of poor parents. Left an orphan at the age of
eight years, he began a life of adventure at
the age of nine as a cabin boy on the sailing
vessel, Katie Hines, which made Eastern ports
her destination.
At 21 years of age he met Robert Peary, the
famous Explorer. They made several trips to
South America, and were together on eight un-
successful dashes to the North Pole. The last
eventful trip was started July 8, 1908. The
Pole was reached on April 6, 1909. Robert
Peary died in 1920. Henson has been in the
employ of the U. S. Government since 1913.
In the Liberty, a weekly magazine (white),
on July 17, 1926, appeared an article on Mr.
Henson's activities at the North Pole. The
author of that article stated. "Few people real-
ize that Matt Henson, Peary's Negro assistant
was actually the first man to reach the Pole.
Henson, the trailbreaker during the last lap of
the expedition, was there forty-five minutes
ahead of Peary.
The Honorary degree, Master of Science,
was conferred on Mr. Henson by Morgan
College, Baltimore, Md. June 5, 1924.

The Colored School of Sedalia, under the
euidance of Mr. Hubbard, the Supervising

every day school, with six teachers, to its pres-
ent place in the first class list of Accredited

have been erected under his leadership, and
their equipment, have a total valuation in ex-
cess of $250,000. Eighteen teachers are em-
ployed.
Through his efforts, Mrs. Sarah E. Cotton, a
wealthy white woman, of Sedalia, donated a
forty acre track of land for a playground and
park. She made a request to the City Council

honor. The City Council passed an ordinance

A group of liberal-minded New Yorkers,
in 1910, recognizing the situation of the N-
groes about them, drew up a tentative pro-
gram for an organization that has become
known as the National Urban League, and in
April, 1911, he joined them as the field secre.
tary.
The entire movement in 1911, required a
budget of $2,500. Since that date 43 cities have
been organized, and in 1926 the budget had in-
creased to nearly half a million dollars.
Under his general direction no less than
200,000 Negro workers have been placed in
positions; forty-five Negro personnel workers
placed in industrial plants, and thirty-seve:
Negro students trained and placed in social
service positions.
In 1931 there were in addition to the Na.
tional Urban League, forty-three organizations
located in as many cities in the United States,
governed by local executive boards made up of
white and colored people.

She was private secretary to Fannie Choppin

Institute, Augusta, Ga. After her marriage to
Dr. Cornelius McKane, she moved to Savan-
nah, Ga., where she established the first Train-
ing School for Nurses in South East Georgia,
and a public dispensary was also started in con-
junction with this work. Dr. Cornelius Mc-

school. The first class of Nurses was gradu-
ated in 1895.
Later Drs. McKane went to Monrovia, Li-

Health Bureau, Private Hospital and Nurses
Training School. They made many friends
there through Bishop William H. Heard, at
that time U. S. Minister to Liberia. In 1896,
she contracted African fever, which made it

Regaining her health, she and her husband
re-organized the Savannah school, raised con-
siderable money through the cooperation of the
citizens of Savannah, secured a State Charter
and placed the Institution on a firm basis. In

She is the daughter of an affluent and accom-
plished family, her father being an outstanding
merchant. Her mother Mrs. Maze Brooks
Mallory a noted harpist her brother Frank held
a transport license from Roosevelt Field, New
York City until he crashed in Chicago. Another
brother is the husband of Ethel Waters, noted
Maestro.
In 1926 she visited Lexington, Miss., and
when she saw the deplorable conditions of the
Colored folks in that section she decided to cast
her lot with the people of that section. Deter-
mined to accomplish something for the forgot-
ten of the share-croppers she made a survey
and found a little school erected on brick stilts,
a few home made benches, a small group of
children, and an unpaid note of several thou-
sands of dollars. She took this over with less
than $10 in her purse.
. Without the assistance of any\ foundation
funds, endowments, or any definite source of
income, she developed within the short space of
eleven years an institution operating on 350
acres of land, buildings and equipment costing
$50,000. and employes 15 aualified teachers of
various denominations. She also feeds, clothes
and educates 400 boys and girls from the plan-
tation area. There are 12 grades of study, a
Home Economics Department, and is one of
the few Colored schools of education with a
class A standard. About 45 of the 400 students
live in the school dormitories, the rest travel by
mule, ox and foot daily. Only 12 can afford to
pay tuition and the rest are accepted without
pay. Mrs. Mallory clothes many of the stu-
dents and their parents as well. During 1934
during a nation-wide tour, more than 25.000
garments were donated for the people of that
rommunitv.
She has the distinction of being the first
President of a Colored or white school in
Mississippi to represent at the White House
the interests of her work.

Her father fought in the Civil War in the
ranks of the Union forces. Her mother was
forced to flee from Kentucky, taking with her
two small children. She found refuge in Me-
tropolis, where she was later joined by her hus-
band. Annie was the second youngest in the
family of eleven children. She lost both par-
ents while yet a child. Under the care of her
elder sisters and brothers sha completed the
public grade school of Metropolis. She at-
tended high school at Peoria, 111.
Her life has been devoted especially to the
development of Poro College, through which
she has influenced, culturally and economically,
the lives of many Negro women.
Starting in 1900 in a rear room in a small
frame building in Lovejoy, 111., Mrs. Malone
began the manufacture of a preparation to
promote the growth of the hair. In 1902 she
moved her business to St. Louis, locating at
2223 Market St.; in 1910 the business was re-
moved to larger quarters at 3100 Pine St. In
1918 the building now known as Poro College
Building was comoleted and occupied.
Poro Conege Building, Poro Annex Build-
ing and Poro Garage Building comprises the
Poro plant which* with furnishings and equip-
ment, represents an investment of over one
million dollars. Religious, fraternal, civic and
social organizations constantly employ its facili-
ties. The officers of the National Negro Busi-
ness League had their headquarters at Poro
College in 1927. Following the St. Louis tor-
nado disaster of 1927, as one of the principal
relief units of the American Red Cross thou-
sands of storm sufferers were sheltered, clothed
and fed through Poro College.
In July, 1930, marking the further expan-
sion of Poro College, the Institution was re-
moved to Chicago to the location, Poro Block,
44th St. to 45th St. on South Parkway.

In the years 1798 and 1802, were born,
respectively, in the City of Charleston, Richard
Edward and Joseph, DeReef, boys of French
and Indian extraction. About the year 1816,
the elder brother, Richard Edward, was mar-
ried to Isabella Fowler, the daughter of a
wealthy planter in St. John's Parish, South
Carolina. As a wedding present, her father,
jonathan (?) Fowler, deeded to this daughter
a plantation with sufficient hands to operate it.
The young husband, through the means
brought to him by his wife, became a prosper-
ous merchant in Charleston.
Of this union were born seven children, two
boys and five girls. The second daughter,
Ellen Collins became the wife of Alfred
Abram Miller.
In the home of Mr. and Mrs. James Just
(the paternal grandparents of Dr. Ernest E.
Just, of Howard University) in Aiken, S. C,
George Frazier Miller, the sixth and last child
of Alf red Abram Miller and Ellen Collins (nee
DeReef), was born on November 28, 1864.
His thesis for the Master's degree (Master
of Arts) conferred in 1893, was "The Evi-
dential Value of the Moral Argument of
Theism." This production was subjected to
the critical eye of Dr. Philander K. Cady of
the General Theological Seminary who spoke
of it in high terms of commendation, before
it was submitted to the University authorities.
Dr. Miller was a contributing editor to the
Messenger Magazine, and wrote on economi-
cal and social questions during the World War.
It is interesting to note that The Charleston
News and Courier, in its issue of May 18,
1907, containing an article featuring conditions
in that city, in the year 1860, referred to the
fact that Richard E. DeReef paid taxes on 14
slaves and $23,000.00 of real property, quoting
from "List of Taxpayers of the City of
Charleston, 1860," published by Evans and
Cogswell, in 1861.

ing this particular corner he noted that many
school children were in danger of their lives on

the City of Richmond to accept the traffic light
to protect their lives.

as. "Mayor of Harlem" by the League of Lo-
cality Mayor's, Inc. Since then he has opened

ment, now. known as the "Bill Robinson Play-
ground." Mr. Robinson just completed four

Several years ago Congress by resolution
granted power to the Commissioners of the
District of Columbia to appoint two women
on the Board of Education for the Public and
Mrs. Terrell was one of the women appointed.
After serving on the Board for nearly six years,
she resigned. Later the power to appoint mem-
bers of the Board of Education was vested in
the Judges of the District Supreme Court. They
re-appointed her and she served an additional
five years. She was the first Colored woman to
serve on a Board of Education in the United
States.
Mrs. Terrell was chosen one of the speakers
at the International Congress of Women, which
was held in Berlin, Germany, June, 1904.
In 1919, Mrs. Terrell was invited by the
International League for Peace and Freedom
to go as a delegate to Zurich, Switzerland, to
attend a Congress, held there in May. Miss
Jane Addams was president of the League.
Mrs. Terrell was unanimously chosen as the
speaker to represent the United States at the
first large meeting of the Congress, held in the
old cathedral in which women had never been
allowed to speak before. While Mrs. Terrell
was abroad that year Mr. and Mrs. H. G. Wells
invited her to visit them at their home.
Her husband, the rate Robert H. Terrefl,
was one of the Federal judges of the District
of Columbia.

"Ironsides Normal Institute" was founded
by W. A. Rice, a colored Methodist minister,
in 1886. It was taken over by the State in
1894, and since 1900 has been under control of
the State Board of Education, the school's
name having been changed to the "New Jersey
Manual Training and Industrial School for
Colored Youth." During its forty years of ex-
istence the school has had four principals, Mr.
Rice, James M. Gregory, J. T. Caruthers, and
W. R. Valentine, the present incumbent. "Iron
sides" hrst occupied trame dwelling houses on
West and Walnut Streets in Bordentown, then
moved to the Parnell Estate on the outskirts
of town in 1897. This estate had formerly
been the home of Commodore Stewart, com-
mander of "Old Ironsides," whence the school
originally got its name. Bordentown has grown
steadily since its inception, with a rapid growth
of late years due to the influx of colored people
from the South into the State, and the resultant
demand for the instruction of their children in
northern trades. There are at present about
three hundred and fifty students enrolled, of
whom two hundred and ten are boys. Tuition
is furnished free by the State, but the students
pay for their own board and clothing.
Students are given a high school education
accredited by the State Department, at the same
time required to master one of the several
trades offered. The Plant is valued at $1,500,-
000, consisting of 18 buildings, 400 acres of
land, and re<"'stered live stock.

He entered Lincoln University (Mo.) in
1886 and after an early struggle common to
poor youth of the Race, finished at the head
of his class as Class Orator and Valedictorian.
He taught school for several years and then
attended Wilberforce Univ., Ohio, for a time.
He was called to the Presidency of Western
University, at Quindaro, Kansas, then a strug-
gling institution fostered by the African Meth-
odist Episcopal Church. There was but one
building with no more than twenty-five stu-
dents. After ten years under his administration
the Institution was known as one of the best
west of the Mississippi River.
He had introduced and passed through the
Kansas Legislature the bill creating the State
Industrial Department, which brought to the
school many thousands of dollars. He secured
all told, as much as a quarter of a million dol-
lars for the institution, and left in 1906 to as-
sume the position in Washington of Registrar
of the United States Treasury.
He was appointed to this office by the late
President of the United States, Theodore
Roosevelt, and served as Registrar from 1906
to 1910. One of his duties was that his signa-
ture appear on all Government bonds and on
currency of the United States of America. He
resigned this position to assume the Presidency
of Campbell College in Jackson, Miss., one of
the institutions of his church. From there he
went to the pastorate of Avery Chapel in
Memphis, Tenn.
He was a leader of his conference delegation
to the General Conference that met in St. Louis,

He was for eleven years President of the
Lomax Hannon Industrial College, a religious
institution under the supervision of the A.M.E.
Zion Church. During his administration a brick
dormitory for boys, costing $15,000, was built,
many improvements made, and the institution
given a recognized standing among leading de-
nominational schools of Alabama.
He was Instructor of a night school in con-
nection with the Y.M.C.A. for Colored soldiers
in the service of the United States government.
This school was located in Montgomery, Ala.,
and he taught there from 1919 to 1920. In this
city he was for two years Director of Voca-
tional Education at the State Normal School.
Many improvements were made, the debts paid
and the school supplied with all modern appa-
ratus and sanitation.
He made teaching his life's work and in
1921 was chosen President of the Alabama Re-
form School for Negro Boys, which is now
one of the leading institutions of its kind
in the United S.tates under the management
of Negro personnel and supported by the
State Government. Under his administra-
tion it has developed from 50 acres of land
and two buildings to 2,500 acres of land and
24 buildings including a department for de-
linquent girls. Including land, farming
equipment, and livestock, the property is
valued upwards of $500,000 at the present
time. The institution has advanced from
a six-grade elementary school with three
teachers and a 5-month term to an accredi-
ted junior high school with 14 certified
teachers and a 9-month term. His most
outstanding achievement at this institution
was the erection of Margaret Murray
Washington Memorial Building for girls at
a cost of $75,000. The campus and picture
of this new building appeared in the lead-
ing white magazines North and South. It
is a monument not only to the late Mrs.
Margaret Murray Washington but to this
great genius and the negro race in general.
Visitors come almost daily from far and
near to see this school for delinquents that
has no earmarks of a penal institution.
Prof. Wingfield traveled abroad through
Western Europe in 1933, visiting Spain,
Portugal, England, France, and Italy and
made a careful study at first-hand of the
approaches made by those countries in the
solution of the problem of delinquency and
the great Youth Movement. This furnishes
him with much experience and information.
He is considered an authority when it
comes to the work of delinquency and
youth organizations.

history to publish therefrom informing books.
An important purpose of the Association is
the publication of The Journal of Negro His-
tory, a quarterly scientific review of 100 pages
of current articles and documents giving facts
not generally known. This publication has been
regularly issued since January, 1916, and has

the business world.
